Recent post 1: It’s been a couple months since you wrote this but I JUST got to check out the Bigelows and they were spectacular. Thank you for the recommendation!
Recent post 2: Absolutely! We’ve been caught up in the chaos of packing and I haven’t been on here much but I’m certain I’ll post plenty when things quiet down
Recent post 3: Hey Michael! We leave next Tuesday for Maine and have been keeping an eye on the weather. So far it seems like the air quality has been good and should be through tomorrow, though it could change at any point.
