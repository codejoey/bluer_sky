Recent post 1: the man legitimately thought i was trying to fuck with him for a minute but It Happened and tbh since nobody died or got severely injured it was honestly kinda fun?
Recent post 2: when i was in high school my best friend moved to california and i was lucky enough to go visit her once, the day after i got there, there was a 5.4 magnitude earthquake and i called my dad to tell him that if he heard about an earthquake on the news that i was fine and he didnt believe me at first
Recent post 3: oh yeah. absolutely
