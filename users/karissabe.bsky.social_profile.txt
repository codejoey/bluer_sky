Recent post 1: Was randomly thinking about Myspace which made me wonder what ever happened to Tila Tequila and then I remembered that she turned out to be a raging Nazi and flat earther .. the Myspace era really was darker than we all thought huh
Recent post 2: ah thanks for reading and welcome ☁️
Recent post 3: There are some fledgling projects to build a "bridge" between Mastodon/bluesky.. very early and also very unclear how Threads would fit in given they are moving very slowly w/ AP integration as it is
