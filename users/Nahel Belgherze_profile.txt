    Recent post 1: The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) received more than a foot of rain in just 24 hours as a powerful Atmospheric River moved through the region. This rain rate has an Annual Exceedance Probability between 0.1% and 0.05%, or between a 1-in-1000 and 1-in-2000 year rain event.
