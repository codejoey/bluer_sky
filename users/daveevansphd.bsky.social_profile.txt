Profile description: Economist at the Center for Global Development. I mostly share about international development research + books and movies.
Recent post 1: I'll be wearing an #Econ5k t-shirt from a previous year; come and say hi! We'll take a photo in a sort of economic suffering solidarity.
Recent post 2: For economists in the greater DC area who want to join, I'll be running my #Econ5k as part of the Fletcher's Cove ParkRun in Washington DC at 9am Saturday (Dec 23). It's free but you have to register in advance & get a bar code in order to get a time: parkrun.us/fletcherscove/.
Recent post 3: Ha ha, not me! I only do threads for conferences that post full papers.
