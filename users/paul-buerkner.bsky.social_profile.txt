Opinions are my own
Recent post 1: you can still read papers during model pre-training ðŸ˜€
Recent post 2: The title is: "Does Bayes have to be slow? A glimpse into amortized Bayesian inference" indeed new developments :-)
Recent post 3: I will be a host at the Research Explorer Ruhr Event (www.research-academy-ruhr.de/programm/res...) where we invite talented postdocs for two weeks to join us in one of the Ruhr Cities in Western Germany. I am looking forward to your applications. If you have any questions, please reach out to me!
