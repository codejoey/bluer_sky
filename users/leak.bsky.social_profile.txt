Recent post 1: I was not given notification that it was "opposites day". Yes, I use a lot of Commonwealth spellings, but that's no excuse for Google to think the American spellings are British!
Recent post 2: Go home, Google, you're drunk
Recent post 3: People who distribute CSAM are not users you want on your platform for that reason. They're also likely to do things like give you fake credit cards and attract other users you don't want. It's a terrible product strategy not to go after them, moral and legal conversations aside.
