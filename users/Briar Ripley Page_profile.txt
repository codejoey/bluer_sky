    Recent post 1: To be honest I think his most overtly humorous stories (eg “The Town Manager”) are his best, and it’s not close
    Recent post 2: I know for a fact there are people living in poverty & totally written off as lost causes bc of the apparent severity of their disability or mental illness who would be at least as happy, healthy, & high functioning as I am if you gave them unconditional access to sufficient resources and money.
    Recent post 3: I get frequent physical injuries, including sprains, dislocations, and muscle spasms so severe I have to go to the ER. It’s bad. It would be downright shocking to anyone who’s only known me in my more functional state.
