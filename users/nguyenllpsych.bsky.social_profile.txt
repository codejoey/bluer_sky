feeling chatty to cope with dissertation year 💆‍♀️
Recent post 1: whenever i get pass a new academic/professional milestone im simply relieved to never have to do it again because of how rapidly things have become so much amore competitive. excited to one day annoy the youths with my tales of “just cast a wide net and youll get in somewhere”
Recent post 2: wrapped up the last meeting this semester with my undergrad RAs by preregistering their research projects, using my dissertation data that they helped collect! it is truly through the shared excitement and discussions over the years (with 14 RAs in total now..) that my research stays alive 😅 #PhDSky
Recent post 3: a random selection of “oh no academia might not be for me what do”……..
