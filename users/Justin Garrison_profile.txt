    Recent post 1: The doodling, pictures and graphs help me remember the notes better. Not because the picture is meaningful, but because I can visualize the page better and what it says
    Recent post 2: I’ve started taking some notes on an iPad with pencil but I don’t think it’s the same for various reasons.

I need to write a blog post with my thoughts and experience
    Recent post 3: This was frowned on at Amazon for interviews. We had a system to put notes in after interviews and I only put what I wrote down, not what I remembered

I had “bar raisers” tell me I had to do hiring training again because I didn’t take enough notes so I couldnt possibly have had a thorough interview
