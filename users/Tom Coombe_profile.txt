    Profile description: Horror writer, occasionally funny 
    Recent post 1: But I do know that every TV drama that stays with me (The Sopranos, Deadwood, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Americans, Game of Thrones, The Shield, Halt and Catch Fire) is at least a little— and often very—funny.
    Recent post 2: This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. We watch a lot of 3-6 episode British miniseries, many of which are pretty bleak and humorless . They’re also ultimately kinda forgettable.

I don’t know how to strike that balance or whether it’s even always appropriate.
    Recent post 3: Watching Apple TV’s latest sci-fi drama. $2.8 trillion company couldn’t afford a sense of humor. 

And while the show is engaging enough, this fact pretty much ensures I won’t remember it a year from now.
