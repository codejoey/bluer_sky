Recent post 1: I guess ill just find the beauty on them like beauty marks.
Recent post 2: I should get rid of coffe. I only take it when i "need help to work" and when i am in this mindset i have already started taking damage.
Its also that i feel anxious pretty often so why add more anxiety to the mix?
Recent post 3: it looks so disgusting when i read typos or just plain bad redaction in my tweets. It kills an aesthetic pleasure i would like to conserve, but it seems to be also a reflective cringe mechanism that activates when i interact with things related to myself.
