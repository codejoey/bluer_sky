printmaking | pottery 

I make art combining wildlife and folklore; I can also be found baking up a storm, wishing on shooting stars, and dancing with my dog.

Recent post 1: I imagine it is! I got it as a Christmas present back in 2022 from a friend and it didn't come with a business card or anything so I'm not sure who did it. But with a little snooping on google you may be able to track down the artist! 👀👍
Recent post 2: Finally thrifted the perfect frame for this print
Recent post 3: I'm tired of moving and learning new platforms, and I like what I have with my own website (and the control I have over it vs being at the mercy of a third party) so I have zero intentions to move my blog.
