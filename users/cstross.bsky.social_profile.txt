Recent post 1: Yes, but I think they learned better than to put *anything* important in their manifesto. If Labour committed to "rejoin the EU" then (a) the RW press would crucify them, and (b) they'd lose about 25% of their voters (the idiot "but mah sovrenity!!!" crowd). FPTP is the Original Sin of UK politics.
Recent post 2: Sensible Hugo administrator appointed for 2024 (Glasgow) Hugos:

(I know Nicholas and I think he's the right person for the job: former independent diplomat, real-world election experience from Northern Ireland, and Hugo admin experience prior to Chengdu.)
Recent post 3: Zero, which is why even Rishi Sunak is very cautiously talking about cooperation with the EU.

If there's a Labour government and they get re-elected (some time after 2029) I expect the UK to be back inside the EU in all but name. (And with dramatically reduced influence and affluence.)
