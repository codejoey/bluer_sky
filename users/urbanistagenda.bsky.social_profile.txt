Recent post 1: That's because the video was only about cycling. I have another video planned about Oslo that will talk about this, if I ever get around to finishing the script.
Recent post 2: So you're just trolling. I never said any of that. I also never said that highways are bad, only that they shouldn't go through cities.

But instead of using this as an opportunity to learn you're just like a sports fan when someone insults the home team. This I why I block instead of engaging. ðŸ™„
Recent post 3: Yes. Highway interchanges are terrible everywhere. Do you have a point or are you just trolling?
