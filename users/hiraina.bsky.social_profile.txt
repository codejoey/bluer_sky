Recent post 3: I for one am blardy glad its finally finished. It's been 18months-2yrs of disruption. Starting in 2019 with prework drilling etc then nothing until 2021. 2x everyday putting up with impatient people running red lights, agro, behaving badly but now..... It surely is a 'thing a beauty' 🤩
