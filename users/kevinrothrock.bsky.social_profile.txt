Recent post 1: Yulia says they aren't; Navalny can only be viewed as a national hero. If Navalnaya going to make a run at politics, I assume she'll need to be a bit more flexible than this, though she is in grieving, of course.
Recent post 2: Navalny's widow spars w Boris Nadezhdin, the antiwar politician who recently mobilized the hopes of many in Russiaâ€™s opposition in a failed presidential candidacy campaign, after he demands the release of Navalny's body with the caveat that "people are entitled to different views on Alexey Navalny."
Recent post 3: It was an honor to speak to one of the foremost foreign correspondents working in Ukraine today about his very personal book on how war came to Ukraine and transformed the nation.
