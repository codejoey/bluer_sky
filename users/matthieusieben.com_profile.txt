Recent post 1: That's right.
Recent post 2: Exactly! But this only concerns delegating login (like you would with Google, Facebook, etc).

The use case we want to achieve in priority is the ability for any app to get credentials for any PDS. We currently discourage using the resulting user DID as identification anywhere else than with the PDS
Recent post 3: The difference between "Login with X" and "Login with ATPROTO" is that, in the latter case, there is no pre-established trust between the client and X. Because of that, there is more work to do on the client to verify the actual identity of the user, which is why we currently do not recommend this.
