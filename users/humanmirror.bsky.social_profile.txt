Recent post 1: This study from the University of Washington & Stanford seeks to establish a framework to analyze the "reasoning" of medical AI.
The team used GenAI to create pairs of skin lesion images to alter the model's prediction. Dermatologists then identified the AI's relevant decision features. ðŸ’¡
Recent post 2: Interesting! 
This paper from Google DeepMind shows LLMs can find patterns with self-generated reasoning. 
By only feeding minimal input, the system constructs its own CoT (Chain of Thought), boosting performance + unlocking insights to analyze the modelâ€™s reasoning patterns arxiv.org/abs/2402.10200
