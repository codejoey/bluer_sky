    Recent post 1: “I would do it again today,” Gov. Andy Beshear said of his '23 veto of SB150.

And should HB47 — a GOP-backed “religious liberty” bill opponents say would weaken local fairness laws —pass, he vowed to get his “veto pen ready.”

    Recent post 2: Say a full day of service as a juror is eight hours.

At the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, that would be $58 for a day.

Kentucky's current rate of daily juror pay is $12.50.

For eight hours, that's $1.56 per hour.
