Payroll: fangraphs.com/roster-resou...

Keller was on track to become a free agent after 2025. He is now under contract thru his age-32 season.
Recent post 2: Something I find interesting, whether it means anything or not, is a non-roster invitee with no MLB experience who is issued a number they might actually keep if/when they get to the majors. For the most part, anything under 60. Number 99 is also interesting if it's a pitcher who can throw 99 MPH.
Recent post 3: I'm pretty much caught up on entering all jersey numbers for players in camp. Please let me know if you notice an error or can confirm a number that hasn't been reported. Jersey numbers can be viewed on the RosterResource roster/depth chart pages.
