Recent post 1: To extend my bad metaphor:

It's worse than feedback at a wedding speech.  It's destroying all the sound the wedding couple will hear while they are married...

Recent post 3: To explain this problem: 

When you go to a wedding & someone giving a speech goes too close to the speaker with the microphone.  You get a horrible screeching sound.  That's data (input to microphone) being used to train model (sound from speakers into microphone, feeding back).
